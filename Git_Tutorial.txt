Git Refresher:

Basic Git Commands:

    clone -> bring a repository to your local machine
    add -> track your file and changes in Git
    commit -> save your files in Git
    push -> upload Git commits to a remote repo, like Github
    pull -> pull down changes from remote repository like Github

    >>git status -> shows all the changes made but have not been commited

If a new file is added to the local folder then:
    track the file before it can be commited to git
        to do this you need to use:
            >>git add . (. means track all files)
            >>git add <filename or folder> (in case you want to track only individual folders)

    then commit the changes:
        >>git commit -m "Some changes"

    generate a ssh key locally if not done before

    then we need to push the changes:
        >>git push origin master (origin is the location, master is the branch)
